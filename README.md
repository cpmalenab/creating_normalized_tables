# Database Normalization

The objectives of this notebook are the following:

1. Demonstrate the normalization process through a sample music library database.
2. Present and discuss each *normal form* supplemented by Python code and psycopg2 library to manipulate the PostgreSQL database.
3. Define concepts behind database normalization to better understand the theoretical foundation of the topic.
4. Complement the normalized database using an Entity-Relationship Diagram.
5. Identify possible trade-offs and implications of normalizing a database.
